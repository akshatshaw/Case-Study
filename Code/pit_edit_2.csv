After casting, only solid sections of the ingots were taken to prepare test specimens. The sections were first soaked for 30 minutes and hot rolled. The temperatures were 1205 C and 1095 C, depending upon hot ductility of the heats. The hot rolled specimens were pickled in a solution containing 10% HNO3 and 2% HF at 65 C to remove the hot working scale, cold rolled to 2 mm, annealed at 1065 C for 5 minutes, water quenched, and pickled again in the same HNO3-HF solution at 65 C. A small section was cut from each heat and used for chemical analysis.","Nitrogen, which is an austenite stabilizer, shifts the a-'y phase boundaries in Fe-Cr-Ni alloys, as described in Figure 8.","Some compositions were provided with ""~"" and ""<"" signs in the paper",54,Fe Alloy

As determined by X-ray analysis, the alloys with more than 5% Mn contained austenite and ferrite. No traces of ??-phase were detected. The amount of ??-phase depended upon the steel composition.  The higher the Mn content was and the lower the C and the N contents were, the greater the amount of ??-phase present. However, heat-to-heat variations also very likely influenced the phase composition of the alloys under investigation. In all specimens, small particles of a foreign phase were detected. They were identified by electron probe analysis as carbides (presumably Me23C6).",66,Fe Alloy

The experimental procedure was to first polarize the electrode potentiostatically at the least noble potential within the passive region for at least 15 min in order to achieve steady-state passivity. The potential was then advanced in stages of 50 mV, allowing 5 min between each change. Initially the current decreased or remained constant after each potential adjustment, but eventually a steadily increasing current at some potential V'c indicated the onset of pitting (or of transpassivity). Steady-state values Vc were obtained subsequently by holding the potential for long times at a fixed value and then observing pitting or the lack of it under a low power microscope. The lowest potential for which pitting could not be observed after a 10-hr or longer period of constant polarization was considered to be the steady-state value Vc.
