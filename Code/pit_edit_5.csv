The Cr, Mo, C, Si, and N content was not analyzed, but assumed to be in the range of the series. The electrodes for the potentiodynamic studies were mounted in acrylic plastic, the exposed surface (0.5 by 0.6 cm) always being a longitudinal section parallel to the rolled surface. The exposed surface was polished using standard metallographic techniques, ending with a distilled water slurry of 0.3~ alumina. For the pitting potential measurements, the electrode surface was masked with electroplaters tape (Scotch 470), except for a circular area 0.36 cm in diameter.",11,Fe Alloy
